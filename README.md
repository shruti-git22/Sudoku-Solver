# Sudoku Solver in Python

A Python program that solves any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm — a classic example of recursion and constraint satisfaction.

## Features

-Solves standard 9×9 Sudoku puzzles efficiently

-Uses recursion and backtracking

-Validates each move for row, column, and 3×3 subgrid constraints

-Clean, beginner-friendly code structure

-Can be easily extended into a GUI or web app

## What I Learned
