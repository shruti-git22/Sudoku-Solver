# TITLE : Sudoku Solver in Python ðŸ§© 

## ðŸš€ Overview

- The solver uses a recursive backtracking approach, which systematically tries all possible numbers in each empty cell until it finds a valid configuration that satisfies Sudoku constraints.
- This project is a Sudoku Solver built using Python and the Backtracking Algorithm.
- It takes an unsolved 9Ã—9 Sudoku grid and fills in all empty cells (0) while ensuring that Sudoku rules are followed.
- This project demonstrates:

Recursive problem solving

Constraint validation (rows, columns, and 3Ã—3 subgrids)

Use of control flow and logical reasoning in Python

## Algorithm : 
The algorithm works recursively:
Find the next empty cell (value 0).

Try filling numbers 1â€“9 in that cell.

For each number, check if it is valid using Sudoku rules.

If valid, place the number and recursively solve the next cell.

If no valid number leads to a solution, backtrack â€” reset the cell to 0 and try the next possible number.

This process continues until the entire grid is filled or no valid configuration exists.

## Validation Function: is_valid_move()

Checks whether placing a number in a given cell follows Sudoku constraints:
âœ… Row Check: The number must not already appear in the current row.

âœ… Column Check: The number must not appear in the current column.

âœ… 3Ã—3 Subgrid Check: The number must not appear in the 3Ã—3 box corresponding to that cell.

## Features

-Solves standard 9Ã—9 Sudoku puzzles efficiently

-Uses recursion and backtracking

-Validates each move for row, column, and 3Ã—3 subgrid constraints

-Clean, beginner-friendly code structure

-Can be easily extended into a GUI or web app
